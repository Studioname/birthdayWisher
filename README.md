# birthdayWisher
An application for sending birthday wishes

I completed this on expert mode. While my code was a bit longer than the teachers, it still worked and went smoothly, even if my code was a bit more simple. There were 3
differences that really stood out:

1. I simply used day and month instead of the whole datetime.now. This is kind of a moot point, and I think i would prefer to use day and month for the sake of simplicity.
2. Use of tuples for (current_day,current_month) and (dict[day_of_birth], dict[month_of_birth])
3. Using dicts. 

I will try to make an effort to use tuples in future because I haven't really used them enough. The fact that are immutable initially put me off [since i like things to be
dynamic] but in cases like this they would have come in handy. I could also stand to use dicts more because I don't fully understand them.
